        <h1>Burhan Marvi Lab 1: Intro to HTML</h1>
        <h2>First, the basics.</h2>

        <p>You need the following to build your website.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>HTML and CSS</li>
            <li>Javascript</li>
            <li>Node.js</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You should list your top 3 goals for the class below.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Learn front-end web design</li>
            <li>Learn new programming languages</li>
            <li>Learn popular web dev frameworks</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Favourite Albums</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Moosetape by Sidhu Moose Wala</li>
            <li>Not by Chance by AP Dhillon</li>

        </ol>


        <h2>Let's Try Some Inline Elements</h2>
        <p>Sometimes you want to <em>draw attention</em> to something in a line of text.</p>
        <p>Sometimes you want to <strong>strongly emphasize</strong> something in the text.</p>
        <p>Sometimes you want <em><strong>to do both.</strong></em></p>


        <h2>Empty Elements</h2>
        <p>Soft line breaks can't wrap anything.<br> Neither can image tags, or hard lines.<br>Add a hard line under here, and make sure you've used some soft line breaks to match your page to the sample.</p>
        <hr/>

        <h2>Images</h2> 
        <p>Don't forget to use alt text on your images. It's important for accessibility.</p>
        <img src = "images/mochi.gif" alt = "dancing mochi in bubble">
        <img src = "images/mochi.jpg" alt = "mochi ball in bubble">
        <img src = "images/mochi.png" alt = "happy mochi in pubble">
        <img src = "images/mochi.svg" alt = "high quality mochi bubble">
